/* Iterate elements (properties/scopes) under 'path'. This functions acts

   the caller about property's/scope's grammar tokens location and content. The
   principal difference is sp_iterate() allows to address a specific location
   the iteration should take place.

   The path is defined as: [/][TYPE][:]NAME/[TYPE][:]NAME/...
   where TYPE and NAME specify scope type and name on a given path level with
   ':' character as a separator. To address untyped scope /:NAME/ shall be used.
   In case ':' is not provided, 'deftp' is used as the default scope type, in
   which case /NAME/ is translated to /deftp:NAME/. As a conclusion: if 'deftp'
   is NULL or "", /NAME/ is translated to /:NAME/, that is, it provides an
   alternative way to address untyped scopes. To address the global scope
   (0-level) 'path' shall be set to NULL, "" or "/".

   For split scopes there is possible to provide specific split-scope index
   (0-based) where the iteration shall occur, by appending "@n" to the scope
   name in the NAME token. "@*" names overall (combined) scope and is assumed
   if no @-addressing is provided in NAME. "@$" denotes last split-scope index
   (usage of this construct shall be avoided due to additional overhead needed
   for tracking the scope in question).

   NOTE: Both TYPE and NAME may contain escape characters. Primary usage of them
   is escaping ':', '/'  and '@' in the 'path' string to avoid ambiguity with
   the path specific characters.

   'in' and 'p_parsc' provide input to parse with a given parsing scope.

   'cb_prop' and 'cb_scope' specify property and scope callbacks. The callbacks
   are provided with strings (property name/value, scope type/name) written
